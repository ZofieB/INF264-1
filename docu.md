### Learn function

### Tree class
The decision tree itself is modeled as a class node. There is no specific class for the tree itself. In our case we assume that every tree
is just a root node, that is connected to all it's children. So we went for an object oriented approach in modeling the tree itself, but we 
did not include the learning and prediction function itself.
