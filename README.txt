The decision tree classifier is written in Python.

Our code for the projects consists of only one jupyter notebook file.
The notebook file works as a program in a whole and each cell needs to be excuted in the given order.
It also contains all the necessary output and each cell is marked with its functionality.

It is important to have all the necessary modules for the execution downloaded and ready.
We used:
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    sklearn
